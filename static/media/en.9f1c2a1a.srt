00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,041
Applications of machine learning and AI have proliferated at astounding speeds 

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:14,041
due to the maturing of a variety of use cases, as well as ever-increasing amount
of data and network connectivity.

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:21,416
AI so far for the most part has used a centralized model where large amounts of 
data are aggregated and processed,

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,500
and as a result has given rise to various business models 

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:35,041
where “data monopolies” are created with strengthening network effects, a 
phenomenon often seen in the consumer internet space. 

6
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:44,250
Applications are also having to upgrade their data infrastructure and datacenters for 
rapidly growing amounts of structured and unstructured data.   

7
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:51,916
However, the trend of evolving data and AI-enabled capabilities have come to crossroads

8
00:00:52,291 --> 00:01:03,541
with increasing issues regarding user data privacy, enterprise data privacy, as well as 
tightening data regulations across various jurisdictions across the world.

9
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:14,125
As a result, an increasing number of enterprises and individuals are 
wary to use and engage with applications and interaction touchpoints 

10
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:22,750
where data privacy is unclear or in doubt,  creating new bottlenecks for various 
data-intensive  AI use cases.

11
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:32,833
What’s fascinating however, is that these also come at the same time as steadily 
rising number of IoT and smart devices, 

12
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,000
as well as devices having increasingly powerful computational capacity, 

13
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:50,041
as well as a growing of trend of applications looking to “decentralize” computation, increase 
performance, and improve data sovereignty by leveraging edge computing technology. 

14
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:59,375
All of these factors are fueling a rise in a new machine learning paradigm – what 
we refer to as Federated Learning. 

15
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:11,833
Federated Learning is a newer approach to AI where collaborative AI from data of various
users and participants can occur without having to sacrifice data privacy

16
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:16,333
at the same time of potentially better safeguarding data security. 

17
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:24,625
Federated Learning decentralizes the process by training models across local computing nodes or devices

18
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:30,625
instead of aggregating data and training centrally, which is the prevalent method currently. 

19
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:42,750
This also reduces the computational burden of the original single-party machine learning 
approach by leveraging computation resources of localized devices and edge computing.

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:56,916
Actual implementation of federated learning solutions often touches upon a number of technologies 
at the intersection machine learning, deep learning, blockchain, IoT and edge computing.

21
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:12,125
Federated Learning is already being used and tested, sometimes at large scale across various 
industries including finance, healthcare, smart vehicles, consumer applications, and manufacturing. 

22
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:18,791
It is however still in its relative infancy in terms of technology and adoption maturity. 

23
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:32,500
The implementation of the technology, best-practices, nuances, and know-hows are relatively 
obscure for various enterprises and organizations and often are not well documented. 

24
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:45,208
Federated Learning Consortium, or FLC, is a global non-profit organization whose goals are to 
advance the understanding and real world use-cases of federated learning

25
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,625
as well as related privacy-preserving technologies such as multi-party computation, in a collaborative manner

26
00:03:52,916 --> 00:04:04,875
in which research, technology solutions, system integration know-how, and practical 
case studies are synergized, as well as through discussion and project collaboration.
